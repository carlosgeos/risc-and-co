Chosen operand: Greater or equal than (>=)

a)
0xFFFE register 1 (negative number)
0x0002 register 2 (positive number)
0x0000 register 3 (false)

These test vectors have been chosen because a comparison can be made between two signed numbers, the first one negative and the other positive.

b)
0x0002 register 1 (positive number)
0xFFFE register 2 (negative number)
0x0001 register 3 (result true)

These test vectors have been chosen because a comparison can be made between two signed numbers, the first one positive and the other negative.

c)
0x0002 register 1
0x0002 register 2
0x0001 register 3 (result true)

These test vectors have been chosen because a comparison can be made between two positive numbers which are equal.

d)
0xFFFE register 1
0xFFFE register 2
0x0001 register 3 (result true)

These test vectors have been chosen because a comparison can be made between two negative numbers which are equal.

e)
0x0000 register 1
0x0000 register 2
0x0001 register 3 (result true)

These test vectors have been chosen because a comparison can be made between two positive signed numbers which are both 0.

f)
0x0006 register 1
0x0003 register 2
0x0001 register 3 (result true)

These test vectors have been chosen because a comparison can be made between two different positive numbers. First number stored in register 1 is bigger than the second number stored in register 2.

g)
0x0003 register 1
0x0006 register 2
0x0000 register 3 (result false)

These test vectors have been chosen because a comparison can be made between two different positive numbers. Second number stored in register 2 is bigger than the first number stored in register 1.

h)
0xFFFB register 1
0xFFFA register 2
0x0001 register 3 (result true)

These test vectors have been chosen because a comparison can be made between two different negative numbers. First number stored in register 1 is bigger than the second number stored in register 2.

i)
0xFFFA register 1
0xFFFB register 2
0x0000 register 3 (result false)

These test vectors have been chosen because a comparison can be made between two different negative numbers. Second number stored in register 2 is bigger than the first number stored in register 1.
